## FlashCard App

## Lab 1

### App Description
This app displays a question and three choices for an answer. Tapping the question will reveal the answer and tapping the answer will bring the question back. The choices change color to show whether it is correct or not. Green means it is right and red means it was wrong. You can press the eye icon to hide and unhide the choices.
